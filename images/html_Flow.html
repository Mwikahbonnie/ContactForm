                <h1 style="color:red">Geographic Information Systems</h1>
                <p>A geographic information system (<strong>GIS</strong>), or more <br> commonly referred to as a geospatial 
                    information system is a system for capturing, storing, analyzing and <br> managing data 
                    and associated attributes which are spatially referenced to the earth.<br> In the strictest 
                    sense, it is a computer system capable of integrating, storing, editing, <br> analyzing, 
                    sharing, and displaying geographically-referenced information.<br> In a more generic sense, 
                    GIS is a tool that allows users to create interactive queries <br> (user created searches), 
                    analyze the spatial information, edit data, and present the results of <br> all these operations. 
                    Geographic information science is the science underlying the applications <br> and systems, taught 
                    as a degree program by several universities.</p>

                      <P>Geographic information system technology can be used for scientific<br> investigations, 
                        resource management, asset management, Environmental Impact Assessment,<br> Urban planning, 
                        cartography, criminology, history, sales, marketing, and route planning.<br> For example, a GIS 
                        might allow emergency planners to easily calculate emergency response times<br> in the event of a 
                        natural disaster, a GIS might be used to find wetlands that need protection<br> from pollution, 
                        or a GIS can be used by a company to find new potential customers similar to<br> the ones they 
                        already have and project sales due to expanding into that market.In urban<br> planning GIS is 
                        appliedas shown in the picture below.</P>

                <p>Planners, developers, landscape architects, and urban designers 
                can use Esri maps and spatial analytics to make<br> the case for change, 
                streamline the development process</p>

                <h1 style="color:red">Remote Sensing</h1>

                <p><strong>Remote Sensing</strong> generally refers to the use of satellite- 
                    or aircraft-based sensor technologies to <br>detect and classify objects 
                    on Earth, including on the surface and in the<br> atmosphere and oceans, based 
                    on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation).<br> Remote sensors collect 
                    data by detecting the energy that is reflected from Earth. <br>These sensors 
                    can be on satellites or mounted on aircraft.</P>

                    <p>Remote sensors can be either passive or active. Passive sensors respond<br> 
                            to external stimuli. They record natural energy that is reflected or<br> emitted 
                            from the Earth's surface. The most common source of radiation detected <br>
                            by passive sensors is reflected sunlight.</p>
